                Any string that you can use on 2 blocks to pair them into being toggled between grid sizes with R/same-number.
                Should not be used on more than 1 block of each grid size and should not be omitted. The subtype without the size indicator is a good one to use.
                Also used by BlockLimits in world settings (usable in DS GUI).
                And also used by mechanical blocks (rotors/pistons/suspensions) as a target for &lt;RotorTop&gt;/etc instead of a subtypeId which is important for "Add small top" from terminal to work.
